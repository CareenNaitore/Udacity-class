# HTML 
In this class we were taught by karl and Kelly. They took us through the proper build block of a HTML code:
This is an example of an html code that generates a checkers box it contains the fundamntal structure of a html code:
1. DOCTYPE html
2. html
3. head
4. body
A html file has an openning tag and a closing tag eg `<ul> </ul>`
The documents containing html files are in .html

`<!DOCTYPE html>`
`<html lang="en">`
   `<head>`
     `<meta charset="utf-8">`
      `<title Flexbox practice! /title>`
        `<link rel="stylesheet" href="C:\Users\User\Documents\udacity\flexbox_practice_style.css">`
         `</head>`
             `<body>`
                 `<div class= "container">`
                   `<div class="box red"></div>`
                    `<div class="box black"></div>`
                      `<div class="box black"></div>`
                        `<div class="box red"></div>
    `</div>`
     `</body>`
      `</html>`
