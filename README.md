# UDACITY CLASS 
THIS is a project i was able to acquire for generating soft skills on udacity class currently we are being prepared for class in HTML,CSS, python and java 
The class is introduction to software enginerring courses 
This includes:
## 1.HTML 
In this class we were taught by karl and Kelly. They took us through the proper build block of a HTML code:
This is an example of an html code that generates a checkers box it contains the fundamntal structure of a html code:
1. DOCTYPE html
2. html
3. head
4. body
A html file has an openning tag and a closing tag eg `<ul> </ul>`
The documents containing html files are in .html

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

`<html lang="en">`
   
   `<head>`
     
     `<meta charset="utf-8">`
     
     `<title Flexbox practice! /title>`
        
        `<link rel="stylesheet" href="C:\Users\User\Documents\udacity\flexbox_practice_style.css">`
        
        `</head>`
            
            `<body>`
                 
                 `<div class= "container">`
                   
                   `<div class="box red"></div>`
                    
                    `<div class="box black"></div>`
                     
                     `<div class="box black"></div>`
                       
                       `<div class="box red"></div>
    
    `</div>`
     
     `</body>`
      
      `</html>`
`

## 2. CSS
Also we were taught by karl and kelly on the beautification style of CSS (cascading sheet style). This language is used together with html to make it more beautiful
and attractive to the view 
The css documents are of three types:
1.They can be generated on their own known as **external css** and are linked to html by using the `<link>` code:eg 
`<link rel= stylesheet href=url>`

2.They can be generated on the head of html known as Internal or **Embedded CSS** as:
they are designed as 
`<style>
ul { 
     padding:0;
}     
</style>`

3.They can be generated on the head of html known as Internal or **inline CSS** as:
they are designed as 
`<p background-colour:red;>` 

## 3.python (introduction)
In this course, we were introduced to python in an adventurous way we employed 
the various packages in python to learn python. Python is an interactive mode on the terminal.
we used the python3 in this study and we were able to determine the different data sets: strings, lists
dictionary and sets. Also we learnt to manipulate this various dataset through spliting and also through ranges.
We got to do a project on python the adventure game and rock paper scissors is a text game that employed:
1. packages in python 
2. concept taught in this class
3. The ability to engage with the games.

Example of a python code used in the study

`#Import the turtle module.`

`import turtle`

`#Create a new turtle named amy.`

`amy = turtle.Turtle()`

`Set amy's color.`

`amy.color("yellow")`

`#Have amy draw a square`

`amy.forward(100)`

`amy.right(90)`

`amy.forward(100)`

`amy.right(90)`

`amy.forward(100)`

`amy.right(90)`

`amy.forward(100)`

## 5.Javascript 
In this course were trained on using javascript and how useful it can be in designing the html website and css language. How the language has the same syntax as other languages such as python, bash and many others. we got to learn the different formulas and functions used in javascript to solve the day to day problems 
we were tasked with designing this project:
### Pixel Art Maker Project

#### Table of Contents

* [Instructions](#instructions)
