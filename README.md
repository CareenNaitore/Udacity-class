The class is introduction to software enginerring courses 
This includes:
## 1.HTML 
In this class we were taught by karl and Kelly. They took us through the proper build block of a HTML code:
This is an example of an html code that generates a checkers box it contains the fundamntal structure of a html code:
1. DOCTYPE html
2. html
3. head
4. body
A html file has an openning tag and a closing tag eg `<ul> </ul>`

`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Flexbox practice!</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="C:\Users\User\Documents\udacity\flexbox_practice_style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
   <div class= "container">
     <div class="box red"></div>
     <div class="box black"></div>
     <div class="box black"></div>
     <div class="box red"></div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>`

## 2 CSS
Also we were taught by karl and kelly on the beautification style of CSS (cascading sheet style). This language is used together with html to make it more beautiful
and attractive to the view 
The css documents are of three types:
1.They can be generated on their own known as **external css** and are linked to html by using the `<link>` code:eg 
`<link rel= stylesheet href=url>`
2.They can be generated on the head of html known as Internal or **Embedded CSS** as:
they are designed as 
`
<style>
ul { 
     padding:0;
}     
</style>
`
3.They can be generated on the head of html known as Internal or **inline CSS** as:
they are designed as 

` 
<p background-colour:red;>
