# UDACITY CLASS 
## python (introduction)
In this course, we were introduced to python in an adventure way we employed 
the various packages in python to learn python. Python is an interactive mode on the terminal.
we used the python3 in this study and we were able to determine the different data sets: strings, lists
dictionary and sets. Also we learnt to manipulate this various dataset through spliting and also through ranges.
We got to ldo a project on python the adventure game is a text game that employed:
1. packages in python 
2. concept taught in this class
3. The ability to engage with the games.

Example of a python code used in the study
`Import the turtle module.`
`import turtle`

`Create a new turtle named amy.`
`amy = turtle.Turtle()`

`Set amy's color.`
`amy.color("yellow")`

`Have amy draw a square`
`amy.forward(100)`
`amy.right(90)`
`amy.forward(100)`
`amy.right(90)`
`amy.forward(100)`
`amy.right(90)`
`amy.forward(100)`
`
