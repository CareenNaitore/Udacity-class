# CSS ( Cascading style sheet)
Also we were taught by karl and kelly on the beautification style of CSS (cascading sheet style). This language is used together with html to make it more beautiful
and attractive to the view 
The css documents are of three types:

1.They can be generated on their own known as **external css** and are linked to html by using the `<link>` code:eg 
`<link rel= stylesheet href=url>`

2.They can be generated on the head of html known as Internal or **Embedded CSS** as:
they are designed as 
`
style
ul { 
     padding:0;
}     
/style
`

3.They can be generated on the head of html known as Internal or **inline CSS** as:
they are designed as 
`p background-colour:red;'
