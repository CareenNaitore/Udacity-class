			<p> Tsetse flies are exclusively found in sub-Saharan Africa between latitudes 14<sup>0</sup> N and 20<sup>0</sup> S.<br>
			    They belong to the genus Glossina which is usually divided into three species groups. <br>
				The fusca group includes several vectors of livestock trypanosomes. <br>
				The palpalis group (mainly: <em>Glossina palpalis</em>, <em>Glossina tachinoides</em>, and <em>Glossina fuscipes</em>) mainly transmits <em>T. b. gambiense </em>in West and Central Africa. <br>
				The palpalis habitat is represented by hot humid forests along lake and river banks or even in coffee and cocoa tree plantations. <br>
				Conventionally, man represents the almost unique parasite reservoir, with anecdotic interventions of domestic animals (pigs, sheep, and goats). <br>
				In East Africa, the morsitans group (mainly<em>Glossina morsitans</em>, <em>Glossina pallidipes</em>, and <em>Glossina swynnertoni</em>) transmits <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em>. Species of the morsitans group or 'game' tsetse of the savannah zones live in open woodland, bushland, or acacia thicket. <br>
				A wide spectrum of animals, notably game animals and domestic cattle, provides a reservoir of infection. <br>
				Human infection occurs sporadically in individuals coming into contact with the zoonotic cycle (hunters, firewood collectors, and tourists),but several epidemic outbreaks with a heavy toll on the populations have been observed.<br></p>
